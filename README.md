# 📬 Gmail Guardrail – Never Forget Your Subject or Attachment Again

**Created by: Amil Joseph**

Have you ever fired off an email…
…only to realize 2 seconds later that you **forgot the subject** or **didn’t attach the file** you promised?

Yeah. Same.
**Gmail Guardrail** is here so that never happens again.

## 🚨 What is Gmail Guardrail?

Gmail Guardrail is a simple browser extension that acts like a friendly bouncer for your outgoing Gmail messages. It double-checks two easy-to-miss but super-important things **before** your email goes out:

1. **Did you forget the subject?**
2. **Did you mention an attachment but forget to attach one?**

If something’s missing, Gmail Guardrail steps in with a clear warning and prevents the email from being sent until you fix it.

## 🧠 How It Works (In Plain English)

When you click **Send** in Gmail, the extension quickly checks:

* Is the **Subject** field empty?
* Does the email body contain words like **“attachment”**, **“attached”**, etc., but no file is attached?

Depending on what it finds:

* If the **subject is missing**, you’ll see a **red warning**:

  > “It looks like you forgot to add a subject.”

* If you **mentioned an attachment but didn’t attach anything**, you’ll see:

  > “You mentioned an attachment, but there isn’t one.”

* If **both** are missing, it gives a combined warning and **stops the email from sending** until you fix the issue.

No more awkward follow-up emails saying, “Oops, forgot the file 😅”.

## ✨ Features

* 🛑 **Blocks sending** when:

  * Subject is empty, or
  * Attachment is missing after being mentioned.
* 🔴 **Clear red warning dialog**, similar to Gmail’s native alerts.
* 🤝 **Works seamlessly inside Gmail** – no extra buttons to learn.
* 🧩 Lightweight, focused, and built just for this purpose.

## 🎯 Why I Built This

This extension was created by **Amil Joseph** after one too many “Sorry, forgot to attach the file” moments.

Instead of relying on memory, Gmail Guardrail gives you a safety net – so your emails look as professional as you intended.

## 🚀 Future Ideas

* Custom keywords for attachment detection
* Optional “Are you sure?” prompts for very short emails
* Support for multiple languages
